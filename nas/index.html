            Stop paying monthly fees for cloud storage. A Network Attached Storage (NAS) device gives you
            central storage for photos, videos, documents, and backups—all under your control, accessible
            from any device, and optionally backed up off-site.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

        <div class="content-inner content-grid">
          <div class="content-main">
            <h2>Central storage for photos, videos, and documents</h2>
            <p>
              A NAS is like having your own Dropbox or Google Drive, but it lives in your home. Instead of
              storing files on individual devices or paying for cloud storage, everything goes to one central
              location that every device on your network can access.
            </p>
            <p>
              We'll set up shared folders for photos, documents, videos, and whatever else you need. You can
              access them from your laptop, phone, tablet, or smart TV. No more emailing files to yourself or
              plugging in USB drives.
            </p>

            <h2>On-site backup and optional off-site / cloud backup</h2>
            <p>
              A NAS is perfect for backing up your computers automatically. We'll configure Time Machine for
              Macs and Windows Backup for PCs, so your computers are always backed up without you thinking about it.
            </p>
            <p>
              For extra protection, we can also set up automatic off-site backups. Your NAS can sync important
              folders to services like Backblaze B2 or AWS S3, or to another NAS at a different location. That
              way, even if something happens to your home, your data is safe.
            </p>

            <h2>Secure remote access to your NAS while traveling</h2>
            <p>
              Just because your NAS is at home doesn't mean you can't access it from anywhere. We'll set up
              secure remote access via VPN or a secure tunnel, so you can access your files, photos, and backups
              from your phone or laptop while traveling.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike cloud services, you control the security. We'll configure strong encryption, two-factor
              authentication, and proper firewall rules so only you can access your data.
            </p>

            <h2>Optional media server (Plex, etc.)</h2>
            <p>
              Many NAS devices are powerful enough to run media servers like Plex, Jellyfin, or Emby. That
              means you can store your movie and music collections on the NAS and stream them to any device in
              your home—or remotely, if you set it up.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can set up a media server as part of your NAS installation, or add it later if you want to
              start with just storage and backups.
            </p>

            <h2>Integration with your network</h2>
            <p>
              A NAS works best when it's part of a well-designed network. We'll connect it via Ethernet for
              maximum speed, put it on a secure VLAN if needed, and configure your network so all your devices
              can access it easily.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're getting a full network upgrade, we can include NAS setup from the start. If you already
              have a network, we'll integrate the NAS with what you have.
            </p>
