            <h2>Who I am</h2>
            <p>
              I'm Jordan, and I'm local to the Cincinnati area—specifically Anderson and the surrounding communities.
              I started Jordan Home Solutions because I got tired of seeing people overpay for mediocre networking
              solutions or struggle with systems that break when the internet goes down.
            </p>
            <p>
              My background is in IT and networking, but I've always been interested in making technology work better
              for regular people. That means designing systems that are powerful enough to handle real-world usage but
              simple enough that you don't need to become a networking expert to use them.
            </p>

            <h2>My philosophy</h2>
            <p>
              I build networks and smart homes I'd want in my own house. That means:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Reliability first:</strong> Systems that work consistently, not just when everything is perfect.</li>
              <li><strong>Privacy by design:</strong> Local-first solutions that keep your data in your home.</li>
              <li><strong>Clean installs:</strong> Professional wiring, proper placement, and attention to detail.</li>
              <li><strong>Honest recommendations:</strong> I'll tell you if a simpler solution is all you need, or if you're better off with something more robust.</li>
              <li><strong>No upsell pressure:</strong> You get what you need, not what I can sell you.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What I do</h2>
            <p>
              I design and install:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Whole-home UniFi WiFi networks for homes that need reliable coverage</li>
              <li>Home NAS storage systems for central storage and backups</li>
              <li>Security camera systems with local recording</li>
              <li>Smart home automation using local-first platforms like Home Assistant</li>
              <li>VPN and remote access setup for secure access to your home network</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Every project is custom-designed for your home and your needs. I don't use cookie-cutter solutions
              or one-size-fits-all packages. We'll start with a free assessment, figure out what you actually need,
              and build from there.
            </p>

            <h2>Areas I serve</h2>
            <p>
              I primarily serve the greater Cincinnati area, including Anderson, Indian Hill, and surrounding communities.
              If you're not sure if I serve your area, just ask—I'm happy to discuss whether I can help with your project.
            </p>

            <h2>Experience & projects</h2>
            <p>
              I've worked on projects ranging from small apartment WiFi tune-ups to large multi-story homes with
              dozens of devices, cameras, and smart home integrations. Every project teaches me something new, and
              I bring that experience to each new installation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Types of projects I've completed:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>UniFi network installations in homes from 1,500 to 5,000+ sq ft</li>
              <li>NAS setups for photo storage, backups, and media servers</li>
              <li>Camera systems with local recording and remote access</li>
              <li>Home Assistant smart home automation setups</li>
              <li>Network troubleshooting and optimization for existing setups</li>
            </ul>
