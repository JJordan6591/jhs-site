            Most smart home systems require cloud services and break when the internet goes down. We set up
            local-first automation that works offline, respects your privacy, and gives you full control.

            <h2>What platforms/tools we use (Home Assistant and more)</h2>
            <p>
              We prefer Home Assistant for smart home automation because it runs entirely on your network.
              Everything happens locally—no cloud required. That means your automations work even when the
              internet is down, and your data stays in your home.
            </p>
            <p>
              Home Assistant integrates with hundreds of devices and platforms, from Zigbee and Z-Wave to
              Wi-Fi devices, smart locks, cameras, and more. It's powerful enough for complex automations but
              can be kept simple if you just want the basics.
            </p>
            <p>
              We'll also work with other platforms if you prefer—Hubitat, OpenHAB, or even simpler setups
              using just HomeKit or Google Home. The key is choosing the right tool for your needs and
              comfort level.
            </p>

            <h2>Examples: lighting scenes, locks/garage, presence automations, notifications</h2>
            <p>
              Here are some common automations we set up:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Lighting scenes:</strong> "Movie mode" dims all lights, "Good morning" gradually brightens bedroom lights, "Away" turns everything off.</li>
              <li><strong>Locks and garage:</strong> Automatically lock doors when you leave, open garage when you arrive, send notifications if doors are left unlocked.</li>
              <li><strong>Presence automations:</strong> Turn on lights when you arrive home, adjust thermostat based on who's home, pause music when you leave.</li>
              <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Get alerts when cameras detect motion, when doors open, when the washer finishes, or any other event you care about.</li>
              <li><strong>Climate control:</strong> Adjust temperature based on time of day, occupancy, or weather conditions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The best automations are the ones you set and forget. We'll design automations that make your
              home feel smarter without requiring constant tweaking.
            </p>

            <h2>Integration with the network and NAS</h2>
            <p>
              Smart home devices work best when they're part of a well-designed network. We'll put IoT devices
              on a separate VLAN so they can't access your main network, configure proper firewall rules, and
              ensure your network can handle the traffic without slowing down.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have a NAS, we can integrate it with your smart home setup. Store camera footage on the
              NAS, use the NAS for Home Assistant backups, or even run Home Assistant on the NAS if it's
              powerful enough.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everything works together: your network provides the foundation, your NAS stores data, and your
              smart home automations make it all feel seamless.
            </p>

            <h2>Privacy and local-first approach</h2>
            <p>
              Most smart home platforms require cloud services. That means your data goes to someone else's
              servers, and your automations break when the internet goes down. We prefer local-first setups
              where everything runs on your network.
            </p>
            <p>
              With Home Assistant and similar platforms, your automations run locally, your data stays in your
              home, and you can still access everything remotely via VPN if you want. It's the best of both
              worlds: convenience without sacrificing privacy or reliability.
            </p>
