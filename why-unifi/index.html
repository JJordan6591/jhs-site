          <p class="page-hero-subtitle">
            Eero, Orbi, and Google Wifi are fine for small, simple setups. But larger homes and demanding usage
            need more—better performance, real scalability, actual control, and proper security. That's where UniFi comes in.
          </p>

          <div class="content-main">
            <h2>Systems like Eero and Orbi are built to be simple</h2>
            <p>
              Plug-in mesh kits like Eero, Orbi, and Google Wifi are designed to be as easy as possible. For smaller
              homes with just a handful of devices, they can work great—and if that's all you need, I'll tell you that.
            </p>
            <p>
              But in larger homes, homes with thick walls, or families running dozens of devices, those systems often start
              to struggle. That's where UniFi comes in.
            </p>

            <h2>Performance & scalability</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>UniFi is built to handle many devices, multiple access points, and high-speed internet connections.</li>
              <li>We can use wired backhaul so access points aren't just talking to each other over the same WiFi they're serving.</li>
              <li>You can upgrade individual pieces over time instead of replacing the whole system.</li>
              <li>UniFi access points are designed for ceiling mounting and proper placement, not just "where the outlet is."</li>
              <li>Better handling of interference and channel management in dense environments.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Control & visibility</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>See which devices are connected and where your bottlenecks are.</li>
              <li>Separate networks for family, guests, and IoT devices.</li>
              <li>We can manage the advanced stuff for you while keeping your view simple.</li>
              <li>Real-time monitoring of network performance and device usage.</li>
              <li>Proper VLANs and firewall rules for security and network segmentation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Security & privacy</h2>
            <p>
              With UniFi, we avoid unnecessary cloud dependencies and keep as much control in your home as possible.
              We harden the network with strong WiFi security, isolated IoT networks, and sensible options for remote access.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike consumer mesh kits that often require cloud accounts, UniFi can run entirely locally. Your network
              data stays in your home, and you control who has access to what.
            </p>

            <h2>When Eero is enough</h2>
            <p>
              If you live in a smaller space and only have a few devices, a consumer mesh kit like Eero can be perfectly fine.
              I'm honest about that. But if you've already tried those and still have dead zones, buffering, or random disconnects,
              UniFi is usually the right next step.
            </p>
            <p>
              The same goes for homes that are growing—adding more devices, more streaming, more work-from-home usage.
              UniFi scales better than consumer mesh kits, so you won't outgrow it as quickly.
            </p>

            <h2>Installation and support</h2>
            <p>
              UniFi requires proper installation and configuration. That's where I come in. I'll design the network for
              your specific home, install access points in the right spots, configure everything properly, and make sure
              it all works before I leave.
            </p>
            <p>
              You don't need to become a networking expert. I'll set it up, show you the basics, and handle any issues
              that come up. But if you want to dig into the advanced features, they're there.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem; color: var(--teal-deep);">UniFi is ideal when:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Your home is 2+ floors or 3,000+ sq ft.</li>
              <li>You have lots of TVs, cameras, and smart devices.</li>
              <li>You work from home and need rock-solid calls.</li>
              <li>You have a detached office, garage, or outdoor areas to cover.</li>
              <li>You've tried consumer mesh kits and still have problems.</li>
            </ul>

              Not sure where you fall? Start with a free assessment and I'll recommend the simplest solution that actually solves the problem—even if that's not UniFi.
