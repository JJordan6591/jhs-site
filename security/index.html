            Most camera systems either require cloud subscriptions or compromise on quality. We install cameras
            that record locally, give you full control, and integrate seamlessly with your home network.

            <h2>Why camera placement and wiring matter</h2>
            <p>
              A camera system is only as good as its placement. We design camera layouts based on your home's
              entry points, blind spots, and privacy concerns. Cameras should cover what you need to see without
              pointing at neighbors' windows or private spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where possible, we use wired (PoE) cameras instead of WiFi. Wired cameras are more reliable,
              don't compete with your WiFi bandwidth, and get power over the same Ethernet cable. For spots
              where wiring isn't practical, we'll use WiFi cameras but plan the network to handle the load.
            </p>

            <h2>PoE vs WiFi cameras</h2>
            <p>
              Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) cameras are the gold standard for home security. They get power and data
              over a single cable, which means:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>No battery replacements or charging</li>
              <li>More reliable than WiFi cameras</li>
              <li>Better video quality and lower latency</li>
              <li>Easier to manage and troubleshoot</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              WiFi cameras have their place—especially for temporary setups or spots where running cable isn't
              feasible. But for permanent installations, PoE is almost always the better choice.
            </p>

            <h2>Local vs cloud recording, privacy tradeoffs</h2>
            <p>
              Most consumer camera systems (Ring, Nest, Arlo) require cloud subscriptions to store footage. That
              means your video is stored on someone else's servers, and you're paying monthly fees forever.
            </p>
            <p>
              With UniFi Protect or similar local systems, all footage stays on your property—either on a local
              Network Video Recorder (NVR) or on your NAS. You can still access it remotely via VPN, but the
              data never leaves your home unless you choose to back it up off-site.
            </p>
            <p>
              Local recording means no monthly fees, better privacy, and faster access to footage. The tradeoff is
              that you need to manage storage yourself, but we'll set that up as part of the installation.
            </p>

            <h2>Integration with the network you design</h2>
            <p>
              Cameras work best when they're part of a well-designed network. We'll put cameras on a dedicated
              VLAN so they can't access your main network, configure proper firewall rules, and ensure your
              network can handle the bandwidth without slowing down everything else.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're getting a full network upgrade, we can integrate cameras from day one. If you already have
              a network, we'll work with what you have and make recommendations for improvements if needed.
