              <div class="faq-question">Do I need to replace my ISP router?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                For most UniFi-based installs, yes—we typically put the ISP modem into bridge mode and use a UniFi
                gateway instead. That gives us better performance, control, and security. For smaller homes or simpler
                setups, we might be able to work with your existing router, but we'll assess that during the free
                consultation.

              <div class="faq-question">How long does a typical project take?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                Most whole-home WiFi installations take a half-day to a full day on-site. That includes installing
                access points, configuring the network, testing coverage, and walking you through everything. More
                complex projects (multiple services, large homes, custom wiring) can take longer, but we'll give you
                a timeline during the assessment.

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">Can you work with my existing UniFi or Eero setup?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                Yes! If you already have UniFi equipment, we can often reuse and reconfigure what you have. We can
                also help optimize existing Eero or other mesh systems, or migrate you from Eero to UniFi if that
                makes sense. During the assessment, we'll evaluate your current setup and recommend the best path forward.

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">Do you offer ongoing support?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                Yes. We offer optional ongoing support packages for troubleshooting, updates, and network maintenance.
                Many clients are fine with just the initial setup and occasional check-ins, but we're available if
                you need help. We'll discuss support options during the assessment.

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">What areas do you serve?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                We primarily serve the greater Cincinnati area, including Anderson, Indian Hill, and surrounding
                communities. If you're not sure if we serve your area, just ask—we're happy to discuss whether we
                can help with your project.

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">Do you provide the hardware, or do I buy it separately?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                We can handle hardware procurement for you, or you can purchase it separately if you prefer. We'll
                provide a detailed list of recommended equipment during the assessment, and you can decide how you
                want to handle purchasing. Either way, we'll make sure everything is compatible and properly configured.

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">What if I'm not tech-savvy? Will I be able to use the system?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                Absolutely. We design systems to be powerful but simple to use. You don't need to become a networking
                expert—we'll set everything up, show you the basics, and make sure you can manage day-to-day use. If
                you want to dig into advanced features later, they're there, but you don't need them to use the system.

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">Can you help with smart home automation too?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                Yes! We set up smart home automation using local-first platforms like Home Assistant. We can integrate
                lighting, locks, climate control, cameras, and more. Smart home setup can be part of a full network
                installation or a separate project. Check out our <a href="/smart-home">Smart Home page</a> for more details.

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">What's included in the free assessment?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                The free assessment includes a walkthrough of your home, signal strength testing, review of your current
                setup, and a discussion of your needs. You'll get a simple summary of what's causing issues and a
                recommendation for how to fix them. No pressure, no obligation—just honest advice.

              <div class="faq-question">Do you work on weekends or evenings?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                We can often accommodate weekend or evening appointments, depending on availability. Let us know your
                preferred times when you contact us, and we'll work to find a time that works for you.
